# Welcome to the Intergalactic Pong Tournament!

A pong tournament to be played on Android devices. All screenshots below were taken on my device running Android 10 where extensive testing was done and I also 
tested the program on Android 9.

This game is made with Unity and programmed in C#.

Get ready to play against the menacing A.I. Swipe up and down to control your paddle and press the middle of the screen to pause the game. The player is informed as to how 
he/she can pause the game with text displayed near the bottom left corner. This text then slowly vanishes by the start of the game so that it doesn't interfere with the match.

The tournament can be tough! Don't worry there is an easier Play mode where players can hone their skills.
